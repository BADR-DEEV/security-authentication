This is one of the sites that iam really proud of.

all it does is sharing secrets with multipale users so you will find some stupid secrets like banana.

i didnt focus in the styling. so this is heavily focused in the backend.

but the security and the authentication is really good.



so nothing intresting here only for the authentication (did i write that write?) and the security




to use it 


*1 go to command prompt and write

cd (the path you put the folder in) for example cd desktop/Todolist

*2 write nodemon app.js (if you have node.js otherwise)

*3 go to chrome and write localhost:3000
